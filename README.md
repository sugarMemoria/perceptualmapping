# Perceptual Mapping based on Amazon Reviews

## Background
This project is designed to practice the perceptual mapping and multidimensional plot (MDP) learned in the Marketing Analytics course using R programming language.

## Step Breakdown
1. The basic unit of doing perceptual mapping on Amazon reviews is brand, so we pick a brand
2. Calculate the metric - cooccurrence
3. Calculate the metric - lift
4. Based on lift, build a dis-similarity matrix
5. Build MDS plot
